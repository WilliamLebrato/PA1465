# Assignment README

Great to have you aboard on PA1465!

**You are the first students who work through these assignments. Your feedback is very welcome.**

## FAQ
- *Can I use ChatGPT or Github Copilot?* Yes, you can. But like for content not from you: Provide a proper reference and make it explicit. Otherwise, we consider it plagiarism since you take someone else's work or ideas and pass them off as one's own. 
- *Will you check that?* Yes, we will. We, too, have access to ChatGPT and the like.
- *I don't know how to install/use/program in Python/Jupyter/...* First, this is not a question; second, you are a software engineer. Who else can make it if not you?
- *What gorgeous formatting is this?* This is [Markdown syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) that allows you to style and format your text in Jupyter notebooks. You are free to use it in your assignments for free-text answers.

## Do and Don't
Before we look at each assignment, we will test your notebooks (yes, also notebooks and tests can be tested) and check for plagiarism. If these checks fail, you will have to resubmit the whole assignment. To get a pass on the first strike, please make sure the following: 

### Do
- Each empty Jupyter cell requires your attention
- Answer the questions in markdown syntax or plain text
- If you need shell commands, use a leading `!`
- Follow Python coding guidelines

### Don't 
- Don't use external libraries not listed in the assignment
- Don't add or remove cells or change the order
- Don't rename files
- Don't plagiarize (see FAQ)
- Don't think the more the better; in fact, for both, code and answers to the questions, conciseness and precision is the key.
